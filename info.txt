Next steps:

// write README
// comment all require out before submitting
// make oracle response back to random

//write in readme:

--> For testing purposes: comment all require out marked with @dev

#============================Learned=============================================#
# Interaction between contracts must not be strings
# use bytes32 key = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(index, airline, flight, timestamp));
# to convert string to bytes32 so it can be properly transmitted
# in addition set mappings in data contract to public
# mapping(bytes32 => Flight) public flights;
# send value in transactions between contract using contract.method.value(xx)(arg1, arg2);
# mark all the concerned addresses and methods as payable 
# correct use of safeMath functions  a = a+b a= a.add(b)
# when function cannot be called from another function she is probable not marked as internal, if must be external than use this
